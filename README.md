## Requirements

* [Docker Community Edition (CE)][docker-ce] (the latest version is `18.03.0-ce` at the time of
  writing)
* A UNIX command line (on Windows, use [Git Bash][git-bash] or the [Windows Subsystem for
  Linux][wsl])



## What is Docker?

Docker is the company driving the **container movement**.  Today's businesses are under pressure to
digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while
rationalizing an **increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application
architectures**.  Docker enables true **independence between applications and infrastructure** and
developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and
innovation.

* [What is a Container?][what-is-a-container]



## Container & image basics

### Make sure Docker is working

Run a `hello-world` container to make sure everything is installed correctly:

```bash
$> docker run hello-world

Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
9bb5a5d4561a: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:f5233545e43561214ca4891fd1157e1c3c563316ed8e237750d59bde73361e77
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

```

### Run a container from an image

Pull the [official Ubuntu image][hub-ubuntu] from the [Docker Hub][hub].

```bash
$> docker pull ubuntu
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
d3938036b19c: Pull complete
a9b30c108bda: Pull complete
67de21feec18: Pull complete
817da545be2b: Pull complete
d967c497ce23: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:9ee3b83bcaa383e5e3b657f042f4034c92cdd50c03f73166c145c9ceaea9ba7c
Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:latest
```

An image is a **blueprint** which form the basis of containers.
This `ubuntu` image contains a headless Ubuntu operating system.

You can list available images with `docker images`:

```bash
$> docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ubuntu              latest              c9d990395902        7 days ago          113MB
hello-world         latest              e38bc07ac18e        8 days ago          1.85kB
```

Run a **container** based on that image with `docker run <image> [command...]`:

```bash
$> docker run ubuntu echo "hello from ubuntu"
hello from ubuntu
```

This runs an Ubuntu container.

Running a container means **executing the specified command**, in this case `echo "hello from ubuntu"`, starting from an **image**, in this case the Ubuntu image.
The `echo` binary that is executed is the one provided by the Ubuntu OS in the image, not your machine.

If you list the running containers with `docker ps`, you will see that the container we just ran is not running any more.
A container **stops as soon as its command is done**.
Since `echo` is not a long-running command, the container stopped right away.

```bash
$> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

You can see the stopped container with `docker ps -a`, which lists all containers regardless of their status:

```bash
$> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
d042ed58ef63        ubuntu              "echo 'hello from ub…"   10 seconds ago      Exited (0) 11 seconds ago                       relaxed_galileo
02bbe5e66c15        hello-world         "/hello"                 42 seconds ago      Exited (0) 42 seconds ago                       jovial_jones
```

You can remove a stopped container or containers with `docker rm`, using either its ID or its name:

```bash
$> docker rm relaxed_galileo 02bbe5e66c15
relaxed_galileo
02bbe5e66c15
$> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

You can also use the `--rm` option with `docker run` to automatically remove the container when it stops:

```bash
$> docker run --rm ubuntu echo "hello from ubuntu"
hello from ubuntu
```

No new container should appear in the list:

```bash
$> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
```

### Container isolation

Docker containers are very similar to [LXC containers][lxc] which provide many
[security][docker-security] features.  When you start a container with `docker run`, you get:

* **Process isolation:** processes running within a container cannot see, and even less
  affect, processes running in another container, or in the host system.

  See the difference between running `ps -e` and `docker run --rm ubuntu ps -e`, which will show you
  all running processes on your machine, and the same as seen from within a container, respectively.
* **File system isolation:** a container has its own file system separate from your machine's.

  See the difference between running `ls -la /` and `docker run --rm ubuntu ls -la /`, which will
  show you all files at the root of your filesystem, and all files at the root of the container's
  filesystem, respectively.
* **Network isolation:** a container doesn’t get privileged access to the sockets or interfaces of
  another container. Of course, can interact with each other through their respective network
  interface, just like they can interact with external hosts. We will see examples of this later.

### Run multiple commands in a container

You can run commands more complicated than `echo`.
For example, let's run a [Bash shell][bash].

Since this is an interactive command, add the `-i` (interactive) and `-t` (pseudo-TTY) options to `docker run`:

```bash
$> docker run -it ubuntu bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/#
```

You can now run any command you want within the running container:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# date
Fri Apr 20 13:20:32 UTC 2018
```

You can make changes to the container. Since this is an Ubuntu container, you can install packages.
Update of the package lists first with `apt-get update`:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# apt-get update
Get:1 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial InRelease [247 kB]
...
Fetched 25.1 MB in 1s (12.9 MB/s)

```

Install the `fortune` package:

```bash

Reading package lists... Done

Note, selecting 'fortune-mod' instead of 'fortune'
The following additional packages will be installed:
  fortunes-min librecode0
Suggested packages:
  fortunes x11-utils bsdmainutils
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  fortune-mod fortunes-min librecode0
0 upgraded, 3 newly installed, 0 to remove and 5 not upgraded.
Need to get 625 kB of archives.
After this operation, 2184 kB of additional disk space will be used.
Get:1 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/main amd64 librecode0 amd64 3.6-22 [523 kB]
...
Fetched 625 kB in 0s (3250 kB/s)
...
```

The [`fortune`][fortune] command prints a quotation/joke such as the ones found in fortune cookies
(hence the name):

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# /usr/games/fortune
Your motives for doing whatever good deed you may have in mind will be
misinterpreted by somebody.
```

Let's create a fortune clock that tells the time and a fortune every 5 seconds. Run the following
multiline command to save a bash script to `/usr/local/bin/clock.sh`:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# cat << EOF > /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
#!/bin/bash
trap "exit" SIGKILL SIGTERM SIGHUP SIGINT EXIT
while true; do
  echo It is \$(date)
  /usr/games/fortune
  echo
  sleep 5
done
EOF
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
```

Make sure it works:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# clock.sh
It is Mon Apr 23 08:47:37 UTC 2018
You have no real enemies.

It is Mon Apr 23 08:47:42 UTC 2018
Beware of a dark-haired man with a loud tie.

It is Mon Apr 23 08:47:47 UTC 2018
If you sow your wild oats, hope for a crop failure.
```

Use Ctrl-C to stop the clock script. Then use `exit` to stop the Bash shell:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# exit
```

Since the Bash process has exited, the container has stopped:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                       PORTS               NAMES
f6b9fa680789        ubuntu              "bash"              13 minutes ago      Exited (130) 4 seconds ago                       goofy_shirley
```

### Committing a container's state to an image manually

Retrieve the name or ID of the previous container, in this case `goofy_shirley`.  You can create a
new image based on that container's state with the `docker commit <container> <repository:tag>`
command:

```bash
$> docker commit goofy_shirley fortune-clock:1.0
sha256:407daed1a864b14a4ab071f274d3058591d2b94f061006e88b7fc821baf8232e
```

You can see the new image in the list of images:

```bash
$> docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
fortune-clock       1.0                 407daed1a864        9 seconds ago       156MB
ubuntu              latest              c9d990395902        10 days ago         113MB
hello-world         latest              e38bc07ac18e        11 days ago         1.85kB
```

That image contains the `/usr/local/bin/clock.sh` script we created, so we can run it directly with
`docker run <image> <command>`:

```bash
$> docker run --rm fortune-clock:1.0 clock.sh
It is Mon Apr 23 08:55:54 UTC 2018
You will have good luck and overcome many hardships.

It is Mon Apr 23 08:55:59 UTC 2018
While you recently had your problems on the run, they've regrouped and
are making another attack.
```

Use Ctrl-C to stop the script (the container will stop and be removed automatically thanks to the
`--rm` option).

That's nice, but let's create a fancier version of our clock. Run a new Bash shell based on our
`fortune-clock:1.0` image:

```bash
$> docker run -it fortune-clock:1.0 bash
root@4b38e523336c:/#
```

Install the `cowsay` package:

```bash
root@4b38e523336c:/# apt-get install -y cowsay
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following additional packages will be installed:
  cowsay-off ifupdown iproute2 isc-dhcp-client isc-dhcp-common libatm1 libdns-export162 libgdbm3 libisc-export160 libmnl0 libperl5.22 libtext-charwidth-perl libxtables11 netbase perl perl-base

Suggested packages:
  filters ppp rdnssd iproute2-doc resolvconf avahi-autoipd isc-dhcp-client-ddns apparmor perl-doc libterm-readline-gnu-perl | libterm-readline-perl-perl make
The following NEW packages will be installed:

  rename
The following packages will be upgraded:
  perl-base
1 upgraded, 18 newly installed, 0 to remove and 4 not upgraded.
Need to get 9432 kB of archives.
After this operation, 44.8 MB of additional disk space will be used.

...
Fetched 9432 kB in 0s (17.5 MB/s)
...
```

Overwrite the clock script with this multiline command. The output of the `fortune` command is now
piped into the `cowsay` command:

```bash
root@4b38e523336c:/# cat << EOF > /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
#!/bin/bash
trap "exit" SIGKILL SIGTERM SIGHUP SIGINT EXIT
while true; do
  echo It is \$(date)
  /usr/games/fortune | /usr/games/cowsay
  echo
  sleep 5
done
EOF
```

Test our improved clock script:

```bash
root@4b38e523336c:/# clock.sh
It is Mon Apr 23 09:02:21 UTC 2018

```

Much better. Exit Bash to stop the container:

```bash
root@4b38e523336c:/# exit
```

You should now have to stopped container. The one in which we created the original clock script, and
the newest one we just stopped:

```bash
$> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
4b38e523336c        fortune-clock:1.0   "bash"              4 minutes ago       Exited (130) 21 seconds ago                       peaceful_turing
f6b9fa680789        ubuntu              "bash"              27 minutes ago      Exited (130) 13 minutes ago                       goofy_shirley
```

Let's create an image from that latest container, in this case `peaceful_turing`:

```bash
$> docker commit peaceful_turing fortune-clock:2.0
sha256:92bfbc9e4c4c68a8427a9c00f26aadb6f7112b41db19a53d4b29d1d6f68de25f
```

As before, the image is available in the list of images:

```bash
$> docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
fortune-clock       2.0                 92bfbc9e4c4c        24 seconds ago      205MB
fortune-clock       1.0                 407daed1a864        11 minutes ago      156MB
ubuntu              latest              c9d990395902        10 days ago         113MB
hello-world         latest              e38bc07ac18e        11 days ago         1.85kB
```

You can run it as before:

```bash
$> docker run --rm fortune-clock:2.0 clock.sh
It is Mon Apr 23 09:06:21 UTC 2018

                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

Use Ctrl-C to stop the script (and the container).

Your previous image is still available under the `1.0` tag.
You can run it again:

```bash
$> docker run --rm fortune-clock:1.0 clock.sh
It is Mon Apr 23 09:08:04 UTC 2018
You attempt things that you do not even plan because of your extreme stupidity.
```

### Running containers in the background

Until now we've only run containers **in the foreground**, meaning that they take control of our
console and use it to print their output.

You can run a container **in the background** by adding the `-d` or `--detach` option.  Let's also
use the `--name` option to give it a specific name instead of using the default randomly generated
one:

```bash
$> docker run -d --name clock fortune-clock:2.0 clock.sh
06eb72c218051c77148a95268a2be45a57379c330ac75a7260c16f89040279e6
```

This time, the `docker run` command simply prints the ID of the container it
has launched, and exits immediately.  But you can see that the container is
indeed running with `docker ps`, and that it has the correct name:

```bash
$> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
06eb72c21805        fortune-clock:2.0   "clock.sh"          6 seconds ago       Up 9 seconds                            clock
```

### Accessing container logs

You can use the `docker logs <container>` command to see the output of a
container running in the background:

```bash
$> docker logs clock
It is Mon Apr 23 09:12:06 UTC 2018
 _____________________________________
< Excellent day to have a rotten day. >

        \   ^__^

            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
...
```

Add the `-f` option to keep following the log output in real time:

```bash
$> docker logs -f clock
It is Mon Apr 23 09:13:36 UTC 2018
 _________________________________________

                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

Use Ctrl-C to stop following the logs.

### Stopping and restarting containers

You may stop a container running in the background with the `docker stop <container>` command:

```bash
$> docker stop clock
clock
```

You can check that is has indeed stopped:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
06eb72c21805        fortune-clock:2.0   "clock.sh"          2 minutes ago       Exited (0) 1 second ago                           clock
4b38e523336c        fortune-clock:1.0   "bash"              17 minutes ago      Exited (130) 13 minutes ago                       peaceful_turing
f6b9fa680789        ubuntu              "bash"              40 minutes ago      Exited (130) 27 minutes ago                       goofy_shirley
```

You can restart it with the `docker start <container>` command. This will re-execute the command
that was originally given to `docker run <container> <command>`, in this case `clock.sh`:

```bash
$> docker start clock
clock
```

It's running again:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
06eb72c21805        fortune-clock:2.0   "clock.sh"          3 minutes ago       Up 1 second                             clock
```

You can follow its logs again:

```bash
$> docker logs -f clock
It is Mon Apr 23 09:14:50 UTC 2018

Stop following the logs with Ctrl-C.

You can **stop and remove** a container in one command by adding the `-f` or `--force` option to
`docker rm`. Beware that it will *not ask for confirmation*:

```bash
$> docker rm -f clock
clock
```

No containers should be running any more:

```bash
$> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

### Running multiple containers

Since containers have isolated processes, networks and file systems, you can of course run more than
one at the same time:

```bash
$> docker run -d --name old-clock fortune-clock:1.0 clock.sh
25c9016ce01f93c3e073b568e256ae7f70223f6abd47bb6f4b31606e16a9c11e
$> docker run -d --name new-clock fortune-clock:2.0 clock.sh
4e367ffdda9829482734038d3eb71136d38320b6171dda31a5b287a66ee4b023
```

You can see that both are indeed running:

```bash
$> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
4e367ffdda98        fortune-clock:2.0   "clock.sh"          20 seconds ago      Up 24 seconds                           new-clock
25c9016ce01f        fortune-clock:1.0   "clock.sh"          23 seconds ago      Up 27 seconds                           old-clock
```

Each container is running based on the correct image, as you can see by their output:

```bash
$> docker logs old-clock
It is Mon Apr 23 09:39:18 UTC 2018
Too much is just enough.
                -- Mark Twain, on whiskey

$> docker logs new-clock
It is Mon Apr 23 09:40:36 UTC 2018
