## Requirements

* [Docker Community Edition (CE)][docker-ce] (the latest version is `18.03.0-ce` at the time of
  writing)
* A UNIX command line (on Windows, use [Git Bash][git-bash] or the [Windows Subsystem for
  Linux][wsl])





## What is Docker?

Docker is the company driving the **container movement**.  Today's businesses are under pressure to
digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while
rationalizing an **increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application
architectures**.  Docker enables true **independence between applications and infrastructure** and
developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and
innovation.

* [What is a Container?][what-is-a-container]





## Containers & images

### Make sure Docker is working

Run a `hello-world` container to make sure everything is installed correctly:

```bash
$> docker run hello-world

Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
9bb5a5d4561a: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:f5233545e43561214ca4891fd1157e1c3c563316ed8e237750d59bde73361e77
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/
```

### Run a container from an image

Pull the [official Ubuntu image][hub-ubuntu] from the [Docker Hub][hub].

```bash
$> docker pull ubuntu
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
d3938036b19c: Pull complete
a9b30c108bda: Pull complete
67de21feec18: Pull complete
817da545be2b: Pull complete
d967c497ce23: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:9ee3b83bcaa383e5e3b657f042f4034c92cdd50c03f73166c145c9ceaea9ba7c
Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:latest
```

An **image** is a **blueprint** which form the basis of containers.
This `ubuntu` image contains a headless Ubuntu operating system.

You can list available images with `docker images`:

```bash
$> docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ubuntu              latest              c9d990395902        7 days ago          113MB
hello-world         latest              e38bc07ac18e        8 days ago          1.85kB
```

Run a **container** based on that image with `docker run <image> [command...]`:

```bash
$> docker run ubuntu echo "hello from ubuntu"
hello from ubuntu
```

This runs an Ubuntu container.

Running a container means **executing the specified command**, in this case `echo "hello from ubuntu"`, starting from an **image**, in this case the Ubuntu image.
The `echo` binary that is executed is the one provided by the Ubuntu OS in the image, not your machine.

If you list the running containers with `docker ps`, you will see that the container we just ran is *not running*.
A container **stops as soon as the process started by its command is done**.
Since `echo` is not a long-running command, the container stopped right away.

```bash
$> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

You can see the stopped container with `docker ps -a`, which lists all containers regardless of their status:

```bash
$> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
d042ed58ef63        ubuntu              "echo 'hello from ubâ€¦"   10 seconds ago      Exited (0) 11 seconds ago                       relaxed_galileo
02bbe5e66c15        hello-world         "/hello"                 42 seconds ago      Exited (0) 42 seconds ago                       jovial_jones
```

You can remove a stopped container or containers with `docker rm`, using either its ID or its name:

```bash
$> docker rm relaxed_galileo 02bbe5e66c15
relaxed_galileo
02bbe5e66c15
$> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

You can also use the `--rm` option with `docker run` to automatically remove the container when it stops:

```bash
$> docker run --rm ubuntu echo "hello from ubuntu"
hello from ubuntu
```

No new container should appear in the list:

```bash
$> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
```

### Container isolation

Docker containers are very similar to [LXC containers][lxc] which provide many
[security][docker-security] features.  When you start a container with `docker run`, you get:

* **Process isolation:** processes running within a container cannot see, and even less
  affect, processes running in another container, or in the host system.

  See the difference between running `ps -e` and `docker run --rm ubuntu ps -e`, which will show you
  all running processes on your machine, and the same as seen from within a container, respectively.
* **File system isolation:** a container has its own file system separate from your machine's.

  See the difference between running `ls -la /` and `docker run --rm ubuntu ls -la /`, which will
  show you all files at the root of your file system, and all files at the root of the container's
  file system, respectively.
* **Network isolation:** a container doesn't get privileged access to the sockets or interfaces of
  another container. Of course, containers can interact with each other through their respective
  network interface, just like they can interact with external hosts. We will see examples of this
  later.

### Run multiple commands in a container

You can run commands more complicated than `echo`.
For example, let's run a [Bash shell][bash].

Since this is an interactive command, add the `-i` (interactive) and `-t` (pseudo-TTY) options to `docker run`:

```bash
$> docker run -it ubuntu bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/#
```

You can now run any command you want within the running container:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# date
Fri Apr 20 13:20:32 UTC 2018
```

You can make changes to the container. Since this is an Ubuntu container, you can install packages.
Update of the package lists first with `apt-get update`:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# apt-get update
Get:1 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial InRelease [247 kB]
...
Fetched 25.1 MB in 1s (12.9 MB/s)

```

Install the `fortune` package:

```bash

Reading package lists... Done

Note, selecting 'fortune-mod' instead of 'fortune'
The following additional packages will be installed:

Suggested packages:
  fortunes x11-utils bsdmainutils
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  fortune-mod fortunes-min librecode0
0 upgraded, 3 newly installed, 0 to remove and 5 not upgraded.
Need to get 625 kB of archives.
After this operation, 2184 kB of additional disk space will be used.

...
Fetched 625 kB in 0s (3250 kB/s)
...
```

The [`fortune`][fortune] command prints a quotation/joke such as the ones found in fortune cookies
(hence the name):

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# /usr/games/fortune
Your motives for doing whatever good deed you may have in mind will be
misinterpreted by somebody.
```

Let's create a fortune clock that tells the time and a fortune every 5 seconds. Run the following
multiline command to save a bash script to `/usr/local/bin/clock.sh`:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# cat << EOF > /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
#!/bin/bash
trap "exit" SIGKILL SIGTERM SIGHUP SIGINT EXIT
while true; do
  echo It is \$(date)
  /usr/games/fortune
  echo
  sleep 5
done
EOF
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
```

Make sure it works:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# clock.sh
It is Mon Apr 23 08:47:37 UTC 2018
You have no real enemies.

It is Mon Apr 23 08:47:42 UTC 2018
Beware of a dark-haired man with a loud tie.

It is Mon Apr 23 08:47:47 UTC 2018
If you sow your wild oats, hope for a crop failure.
```

Use Ctrl-C to stop the clock script. Then use `exit` to stop the Bash shell:

```bash
root@e07f81d7941d:/# exit
```

Since the Bash process has exited, the container has stopped:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                       PORTS               NAMES
f6b9fa680789        ubuntu              "bash"              13 minutes ago      Exited (130) 4 seconds ago                       goofy_shirley
```

### Commit a container's state to an image manually

Retrieve the name or ID of the previous container, in this case `goofy_shirley`.  You can create a
new image based on that container's state with the `docker commit <container> <repository:tag>`
command:

```bash
$> docker commit goofy_shirley fortune-clock:1.0
sha256:407daed1a864b14a4ab071f274d3058591d2b94f061006e88b7fc821baf8232e
```

You can see the new image in the list of images:

```bash
$> docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
fortune-clock       1.0                 407daed1a864        9 seconds ago       156MB
ubuntu              latest              c9d990395902        10 days ago         113MB
hello-world         latest              e38bc07ac18e        11 days ago         1.85kB
```

That image contains the `/usr/local/bin/clock.sh` script we created, so we can run it directly with
`docker run <image> <command>`:

```bash
$> docker run --rm fortune-clock:1.0 clock.sh
It is Mon Apr 23 08:55:54 UTC 2018
You will have good luck and overcome many hardships.

It is Mon Apr 23 08:55:59 UTC 2018
While you recently had your problems on the run, they've regrouped and
are making another attack.
```

Use Ctrl-C to stop the script (the container will stop and be removed automatically thanks to the
`--rm` option).

That's nice, but let's create a fancier version of our clock. Run a new Bash shell based on our
`fortune-clock:1.0` image:

```bash
$> docker run -it fortune-clock:1.0 bash
root@4b38e523336c:/#
```

Install the `cowsay` package:

```bash
root@4b38e523336c:/# apt-get install -y cowsay
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following additional packages will be installed:

Suggested packages:

  rename
The following packages will be upgraded:
  perl-base
1 upgraded, 18 newly installed, 0 to remove and 4 not upgraded.
Need to get 9432 kB of archives.
After this operation, 44.8 MB of additional disk space will be used.

...
Fetched 9432 kB in 0s (17.5 MB/s)
...
```

Overwrite the clock script with this multiline command. The output of the `fortune` command is now
piped into the `cowsay` command:

```bash
root@4b38e523336c:/# cat << EOF > /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
#!/bin/bash
trap "exit" SIGKILL SIGTERM SIGHUP SIGINT EXIT
while true; do
  echo It is \$(date)
  /usr/games/fortune | /usr/games/cowsay
  echo
  sleep 5
done
EOF
```

Test our improved clock script:

```bash
root@4b38e523336c:/# clock.sh
It is Mon Apr 23 09:02:21 UTC 2018

```

Much better. Exit Bash to stop the container:

```bash
root@4b38e523336c:/# exit
```

You should now have to stopped container. The one in which we created the original clock script, and
the newest one we just stopped:

```bash
$> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
4b38e523336c        fortune-clock:1.0   "bash"              4 minutes ago       Exited (130) 21 seconds ago                       peaceful_turing
f6b9fa680789        ubuntu              "bash"              27 minutes ago      Exited (130) 13 minutes ago                       goofy_shirley
```

Let's create an image from that latest container, in this case `peaceful_turing`:

```bash
$> docker commit peaceful_turing fortune-clock:2.0
sha256:92bfbc9e4c4c68a8427a9c00f26aadb6f7112b41db19a53d4b29d1d6f68de25f
```

As before, the image is available in the list of images:

```bash
$> docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
fortune-clock       2.0                 92bfbc9e4c4c        24 seconds ago      205MB
fortune-clock       1.0                 407daed1a864        11 minutes ago      156MB
ubuntu              latest              c9d990395902        10 days ago         113MB
hello-world         latest              e38bc07ac18e        11 days ago         1.85kB
```

You can run it as before:

```bash
$> docker run --rm fortune-clock:2.0 clock.sh
It is Mon Apr 23 09:06:21 UTC 2018

                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

Use Ctrl-C to stop the script (and the container).

Your previous image is still available under the `1.0` tag.
You can run it again:

```bash
$> docker run --rm fortune-clock:1.0 clock.sh
It is Mon Apr 23 09:08:04 UTC 2018
You attempt things that you do not even plan because of your extreme stupidity.
```

### Run containers in the background

Until now we've only run containers **in the foreground**, meaning that they take control of our
console and use it to print their output.

You can run a container **in the background** by adding the `-d` or `--detach` option.  Let's also
use the `--name` option to give it a specific name instead of using the default randomly generated
one:

```bash
$> docker run -d --name clock fortune-clock:2.0 clock.sh
06eb72c218051c77148a95268a2be45a57379c330ac75a7260c16f89040279e6
```

This time, the `docker run` command simply prints the ID of the container it
has launched, and exits immediately.  But you can see that the container is
indeed running with `docker ps`, and that it has the correct name:

```bash
$> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
06eb72c21805        fortune-clock:2.0   "clock.sh"          6 seconds ago       Up 9 seconds                            clock
```

### Access container logs

You can use the `docker logs <container>` command to see the output of a
container running in the background:

```bash
$> docker logs clock
It is Mon Apr 23 09:12:06 UTC 2018
 _____________________________________

            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
...
```

Add the `-f` option to keep following the log output in real time:

```bash
$> docker logs -f clock
It is Mon Apr 23 09:13:36 UTC 2018
 _________________________________________

                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

Use Ctrl-C to stop following the logs.

### Stop and restart containers

You may stop a container running in the background with the `docker stop <container>` command:

```bash
$> docker stop clock
clock
```

You can check that is has indeed stopped:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES

```

You can restart it with the `docker start <container>` command. This will re-execute the command
that was originally given to `docker run <container> <command>`, in this case `clock.sh`:

```bash
$> docker start clock
clock
```

It's running again:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
06eb72c21805        fortune-clock:2.0   "clock.sh"          3 minutes ago       Up 1 second                             clock
```

You can follow its logs again:

```bash
$> docker logs -f clock
It is Mon Apr 23 09:14:50 UTC 2018

```

Stop following the logs with Ctrl-C.

You can **stop and remove** a container in one command by adding the `-f` or `--force` option to
`docker rm`. Beware that it will *not ask for confirmation*:

```bash
$> docker rm -f clock
clock
```

No containers should be running any more:

```bash
$> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

### Run multiple containers

Since containers have isolated processes, networks and file systems, you can of course run more than
one at the same time:

```bash
$> docker run -d --name old-clock fortune-clock:1.0 clock.sh
25c9016ce01f93c3e073b568e256ae7f70223f6abd47bb6f4b31606e16a9c11e
$> docker run -d --name new-clock fortune-clock:2.0 clock.sh
4e367ffdda9829482734038d3eb71136d38320b6171dda31a5b287a66ee4b023
```

You can see that both are indeed running:

```bash
$> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
4e367ffdda98        fortune-clock:2.0   "clock.sh"          20 seconds ago      Up 24 seconds                           new-clock
25c9016ce01f        fortune-clock:1.0   "clock.sh"          23 seconds ago      Up 27 seconds                           old-clock
```

Each container is running based on the correct image, as you can see by their output:

```bash
$> docker logs old-clock
It is Mon Apr 23 09:39:18 UTC 2018
Too much is just enough.

```

### Image layers

A Docker image is built up from a series of layers. Each layer contains set of differences from the
layer before it:

![Docker: Image Layers](images/layers.jpg)

You can list those layers by using the `docker inspect` command with an image name or ID. Let's see
what layers the `ubuntu` image has:

```bash
$> docker inspect ubuntu
...
        "RootFS": {
            "Type": "layers",
            "Layers": [
                "sha256:fccbfa2912f0cd6b9d13f91f288f112a2b825f3f758a4443aacb45bfc108cc74",
                "sha256:e1a9a6284d0d24d8194ac84b372619e75cd35a46866b74925b7274c7056561e4",
                "sha256:ac7299292f8b2f710d3b911c6a4e02ae8f06792e39822e097f9c4e9c2672b32d",
                "sha256:a5e66470b2812e91798db36eb103c1f1e135bbe167e4b2ad5ba425b8db98ee8d",
                "sha256:a8de0e025d94b33db3542e1e8ce58829144b30c6cd1fff057eec55b1491933c3"
            ]
        }
...
```

Each layer is identified by a hash based on previous layer's hash and the state when the layer was
created. This is similar to commit hashes in a Git repository.

Let's check the layers of our first `fortune-clock:1.0` image:

```bash
$> docker inspect fortune-clock:1.0
...
        "RootFS": {
            "Type": "layers",
            "Layers": [
                "sha256:fccbfa2912f0cd6b9d13f91f288f112a2b825f3f758a4443aacb45bfc108cc74",
                "sha256:e1a9a6284d0d24d8194ac84b372619e75cd35a46866b74925b7274c7056561e4",
                "sha256:ac7299292f8b2f710d3b911c6a4e02ae8f06792e39822e097f9c4e9c2672b32d",
                "sha256:a5e66470b2812e91798db36eb103c1f1e135bbe167e4b2ad5ba425b8db98ee8d",
                "sha256:a8de0e025d94b33db3542e1e8ce58829144b30c6cd1fff057eec55b1491933c3",
                "sha256:3539c048e45e973cf477148af3c9c91885950e77d10e77e1db1097bd20b16129"
            ]
        },
...
```

Note that the layers are the same as the `ubuntu` image, with an additional one at the end (starting
with `3539c048e`). This additional layer contains the changes we made compared to the original
`ubuntu` image, i.e.:

* Update the package lists with `apt-get update`
* Install the `fortune` package with `apt-get install`
* Create the `/usr/local/bin/clock.sh` script

The new hash (starting with `3539c048e`) is based both on these changes and the previous hash
(starting with `a8de0e025`), and it **uniquely identifies this layer**.

Take a look at the layers of our second `fortune-clock:2.0` image:

```bash
$> docker inspect fortune-clock:2.0
...
        "RootFS": {
            "Type": "layers",
            "Layers": [
                "sha256:fccbfa2912f0cd6b9d13f91f288f112a2b825f3f758a4443aacb45bfc108cc74",
                "sha256:e1a9a6284d0d24d8194ac84b372619e75cd35a46866b74925b7274c7056561e4",
                "sha256:ac7299292f8b2f710d3b911c6a4e02ae8f06792e39822e097f9c4e9c2672b32d",
                "sha256:a5e66470b2812e91798db36eb103c1f1e135bbe167e4b2ad5ba425b8db98ee8d",
                "sha256:a8de0e025d94b33db3542e1e8ce58829144b30c6cd1fff057eec55b1491933c3",
                "sha256:3539c048e45e973cf477148af3c9c91885950e77d10e77e1db1097bd20b16129",
                "sha256:5dbae8ae43cba9e34980fd6076156503814c916453a5582646a6a34c02c68546"
            ]
        },
...
```

Again, we see the same layers, including the `3539c048e` layer from the `fortune-clock:1.0` image,
and an additional layer (starting with `5dbae8ae4`). This layer contains the following changes we
made based on the `fortune-clock:1.0` image:

* Install the `cowsay` package with `apt-get install`
* Overwrite the `/usr/local/bin/clock.sh` script

#### The top writable layer of containers

When you create a new container, you add a new **writable layer** on top of the image's underlying
layers. All changes made to the running container (i.e. creating, modifying, deleting files) are
written to this thin writable container layer.  When the container is deleted, the writable layer is
also deleted, unless it was committed to an image.

The layers belonging to the image used as a base for your container are never modifiedâ€“they are
**read-only**. Docker uses a [union file system][union-fs] to make it work: when you write file in
the top writable layer, the previous version(s) of the file in previous layers still exist, but are
"hidden" by the file system; only the most recent version is seen.

![Docker: Sharing Layers](images/sharing-layers.jpg)

Multiple containers can therefore use the same read-only image layers, as they only modify their own
writable top layer.

#### Total image size

What we've just learned about layers has several implications:

* You **cannot delete files from previous layers to reduce total image size**. Assume that an
  image's last layer contains a 1GB file. Creating a new container from that image, deleting that
  file, and saving that state as a new image will not reclaim that gigabyte. The total image size
  will still be the same, as the file is still present in the previous layer.

  This is also similar to a Git repository, where committing a file deletion does not reclaim its
  space from the repository's object database (as the file is still referenced by previous commits
  in the history).
* Since layers are read-only and incrementally built based on previous layers, **the size of common
  layers shared by several images is only taken up once**.

  If you take a look at the output of `docker images`, naively adding the displayed sizes adds up to
  447MB, but that is **not** the size that is actually occupied by these images on your file system.

  ```bash
  $> docker images
  REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
  fortune-clock       2.0                 92bfbc9e4c4c        2 hours ago         205MB
  fortune-clock       1.0                 407daed1a864        2 hours ago         156MB
  ubuntu              latest              c9d990395902        10 days ago         113MB
  hello-world         latest              e38bc07ac18e        11 days ago         1.85kB
  ```

  Let's add the `-s` or `--size` option to `docker ps` to display the size of our containers' file
  systems:

  ```bash
  $> docker ps -as
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND      CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS   NAMES                    SIZE
  4e367ffdda98   fortune-clock:2.0   "clock.sh"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour                   new-clock                0B (virtual 205MB)
  25c9016ce01f   fortune-clock:1.0   "clock.sh"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour                   old-clock                0B (virtual 156MB)
  4b38e523336c   fortune-clock:1.0   "bash"       2 hours ago         Exited (130) 2 hours ago           peaceful_turing          48.7MB (virtual 205MB)
  f6b9fa680789   ubuntu              "bash"       2 hours ago         Exited (130) 2 hours ago           goofy_shirley            43MB (virtual 156MB)
  ```

  The `SIZE` column shows the size of the top writable container layer, and the total virtual size
  of all the layers (including the top one) in parentheses.  If you look at the virual sizes, you
  can see that:

  * The virtual size of the `goofy_shirley` container is 156MB, which corresponds to the size of the
    `fortune-clock:1.0` image, since we committed that image based on that container's state.
  * Similarly, the virtual size of the `peaceful_turing` container is 205MB, which corresponds to
    the size of the `fortune-clock:2.0` image.
  * The `old-clock` and `new-clock` containers also have the same virtual sizes since they are based
    on the same images.

  Taking a look at the sizes of the top writable container layers, we can see that:

  * The size of the `goofy_shirley` container's top layer is 43MB. This corresponds to the space
    taken up by the package lists, the `fortune` package and its dependencies, and the `clock.sh`
    script.

    The virtual size of 156MB corresponds to the 113MB of the `ubuntu` base image, plus the 43MB of
    the top layer. As we've seen above, this is also the size of the `fortune-clock:1.0` image.
  * The size of the `peaceful_turing` container's top layer is 48.7MB. This corresponds to the space
    taken up by the `cowsay` package and its dependencies, and the new version of the `clock.sh`
    script.

    The virtual size of 205MB corresponds to the 156MB of the `fortune-clock:1.0` base image, plus
    the 48.7MB of the top layer. As we've seen above, this is also the size of the
    `fortune-clock:2.0` image.
  * The size of the `old-clock` and `new-clock` containers' top layers is 0 bytes, since no file was
    modified in these containers. Their virtual size correspond to their base images' size.

  Using all that we've learned, we can determine the total size taken up on your machine's file
  system:

  * The 113MB of the `ubuntu` image's layers, even though they are used by 3 images (the `ubuntu`
    image itself and the `fortune-clock:1.0` and `fortune-clock:2.0` images), are taken up only
    once.
  * Similarly, the 43MB of the `fortune-clock:1.0` image's additional layer are taken up only once,
    even though the layer is used by 2 images (the `fortune-clock:1.0` image itself and the
    `fortune-clock:2.0` image).
  * Finally, the 48.7MB of the `fortune-clock:2.0` image's additional layer are also taken up once.

  Therefore, the `ubuntu`, `fortune-clock:1.0` and `fortune-clock:2.0` images take up only 205MB of
  space on your file system, not 447MB. Basically, it's the same size as the `fortune-clock:2.0`
  image, since it re-uses the `fortune-clock:1.0` and `ubuntu` images' layers, and the
  `fortune-clock:1.0` image also re-uses the `ubuntu` image's layers.

  The `hello-world` image takes up an additional 1.85kB on your file system, since it has no layers
  in common with any of the other images.





## Dockerfile

Manually starting containers, making changes and committing images is all well and good, but is
prone to errors and not reproducible.

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a [Dockerfile][dockerfile]. A
Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line
to assemble an image. Using the `docker build` command, users can create an automated build that
executes several command line instructions in succession.

### The `docker build` command

This `docker build <context>` command builds an image from a **Dockerfile** and a **context**. The
build's context is the set of files at a specified path on your file system (or Git repository URL).
For example, running `docker build /foo` would expect to find a Dockerfile at the path
`/foo/Dockerfile`, and would use the entire contents of the `/foo` directory as the build context.

The build is run by the Docker daemon, not by the CLI. The first thing a build process does is send
the entire context (recursively) to the daemon. In most cases, it's best to start with an empty
directory as context and keep your Dockerfile in that directory. Add only the files needed for
building the Dockerfile.

**Warning:** do not use your root directory, `/`, as the build context as it causes the build to
transfer the entire contents of your hard drive to the Docker daemon.

### Format

The format of a Dockerfile is:

```
# Comment
INSTRUCTION arguments...
INSTRUCTION arguments...
```

You can find all available instructions, such as `FROM` and `RUN`, in the [Dockerfile
reference][dockerfile]. Many correspond to arguments or options of the Docker commands that we've
used. For example, the `FROM` instruction corresponds to the `<image>` argument of the `docker run`
command, and specifies what base image to use.

### Build an image from a Dockerfile

Move to the `fortune-clock` directory in this repository. You will see that it contains the same
clock script we used in the `fortune-clock:2.0` image, and a Dockerfile:

```bash
$> cd fortune-clock
$> ls
Dockerfile clock.sh
```

The Dockerfile looks like this:

```
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y fortune
RUN apt-get install -y cowsay
COPY clock.sh /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
```

It basically replicates what we have done manually:

* The `FROM ubuntu:xenial` instruction starts the build process from the `ubuntu` base image.
* The `RUN apt-get update` instruction executes the `apt-get update` command like we did before.
* The next two `RUN` instructions install the `fortune` and `cowsay` packages, also like we did
  before.
* The `COPY <src> <dest>` instruction copies a file from the build context into the file system of
  the container.  In this case, we copy the `clock.sh` file in the build context to the
  `/usr/local/bin/clock.sh` path in the container. When we run the build command, we will specify
  the `fortune-clock` directory of this repository as the build context, so that its `clock.sh` file
  is copied to the container.
* The final `RUN` instruction makes the script executable.

Remain in the `fortune-clock` directory and run the following build command.  The `-t` or `--tag
<repo:tag>` option indicates that we want to tag the image like we did when we were using the
`docker commit <repo:tag>` command. The last argument, `.`, indicates that the build context is the
current directory:

```bash
$> docker build -t fortune-clock:3.0 .

```

As you can see, Docker:

* Uploaded to build context (i.e. the contents of the `fortune-clock` directory) to the Docker
  deamon.
* Ran each instruction in the Dockerfile one by one, creating an intermediate container each time,
  based on the previous state.
* Created an image with the final state, and the specified tag (i.e. `fortune-clock:3.0`).

You can see that new image in the list of images:

```bash
$> docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

fortune-clock       1.0                 407daed1a864        3 hours ago         156MB

```

You can also run a container based on it like we did before:

```bash
$> docker run --rm fortune-clock:3.0 clock.sh

Let's take a look at that new image's layers:

```bash
$> docker inspect fortune-clock:3.0
...
        "RootFS": {
            "Type": "layers",
            "Layers": [
                "sha256:fccbfa2912f0cd6b9d13f91f288f112a2b825f3f758a4443aacb45bfc108cc74",
                "sha256:e1a9a6284d0d24d8194ac84b372619e75cd35a46866b74925b7274c7056561e4",
                "sha256:ac7299292f8b2f710d3b911c6a4e02ae8f06792e39822e097f9c4e9c2672b32d",
                "sha256:a5e66470b2812e91798db36eb103c1f1e135bbe167e4b2ad5ba425b8db98ee8d",
                "sha256:a8de0e025d94b33db3542e1e8ce58829144b30c6cd1fff057eec55b1491933c3",
                "sha256:89d694b3a7a4bd236c161894c5aae7d6f86ec3e42c6b4a71032774e60d2d8e4a",
                "sha256:a96e0ea28068686e2bafd181958407d722e179ea5cc3138be5b130424f4925f1",
                "sha256:d57cb59abf79bbe2e4150450574110b862379ecf44d3a23956a965477a0a1848",
                "sha256:0b34384d1bf850620090e95b07cfcf2d552ec869b8f0ea574d8ae81acc2334d2",
                "sha256:a9b1e603de7dd53e2d6adcf3538d454a350e1384a4311b6d686151fabfa450fb"
            ]
        },
...
```

The first few layers (up to the one starting with `a8de0e025`) are the same as before, since they
are the `ubuntu` image's base layers. The last 5 layers, however, are new.

Basically, Docker created a layer for **each instruction in the Dockerfile**. Since we have 4 `RUN`
instructions and 1 `COPY` instruction in the Dockerfile we used, there are 5 additional layers.

### Build cache

Re-run the same build command:

```bash
$> docker build -t fortune-clock:3.0 .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB
Step 1/6 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> c9d990395902
Step 2/6 : RUN apt-get update
 ---> Using cache
 ---> e131accf3a09
Step 3/6 : RUN apt-get install -y fortune
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 56969308655b
Step 4/6 : RUN apt-get install -y cowsay
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 844fbb19235c
Step 5/6 : COPY clock.sh /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 9ff5a0b9ba2b
Step 6/6 : RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
 ---> Using cache
 ---> bcf88ef22f4c
Successfully built bcf88ef22f4c
Successfully tagged fortune-clock:3.0
```

It was much faster this time. As you can see, Docker is keeping a **cache** of the previously built
layers. Since you have not changed the instructions in the Dockerfile, it assumes that the result
will be the same and reuses the same layer.

Make a change to the `clock.sh` script in the `fortune-clock` directory. For example, add a new line
or a comment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
trap "exit" SIGKILL SIGTERM SIGHUP SIGINT EXIT

# Print the date and a fortune every 5 seconds.
while true; do
  echo It is $(date)
  /usr/games/fortune | /usr/games/cowsay
  echo
  sleep 5
done
```

Re-run the same build command:

```bash
$> docker build -t fortune-clock:3.0 .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB
Step 1/6 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> c9d990395902
Step 2/6 : RUN apt-get update
 ---> Using cache
 ---> e131accf3a09
Step 3/6 : RUN apt-get install -y fortune
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 56969308655b
Step 4/6 : RUN apt-get install -y cowsay
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 844fbb19235c
Step 5/6 : COPY clock.sh /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
 ---> 8575c9e05b3c
Step 6/6 : RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
 ---> Running in 037dc123faaa
Removing intermediate container 037dc123faaa
 ---> 99c24c7e3c1c
Successfully built 99c24c7e3c1c
Successfully tagged fortune-clock:3.0
```

Docker is still using its cache for the first 3 commands (the `apt-get update` and the installation
of the `fortune` and `cowsay` packages), since they are executed before the `clock.sh` script is
copied, and are therefore not affected by the change.

The `COPY` instruction is executed without cache, however, since Docker detects that the `clock.sh`
script has changed.

Consequently, all further instructions after that `COPY` cannot use the cache, since the state upon
which they are based has changed. Therefore, the last `RUN` instruction also does not use the cache.

### A Dockerfile for a Node.js application

The `todo` directory contains a sample Node.js application to manage to-do notes.

If you wanted to run this application on your machine, you would need to:

* Install and run a [MongoDB][mongo] database (version 3).
* Install [Node.js][node] (version 8).
* Run `npm install` in the application's directory to install its dependencies.
* Run `npm start` in the application's directory to start it.

That takes some work if you don't already have the database or Node.js, or if you're not used to
installing and managing them.  Let's start with the application itself. With what we've learned so
far, you could write a Dockerfile that installs Node.js, installs the application's dependencies and
starts it.

However, don't forget that images can be shared on the [Docker hub][hub]. Popular frameworks and
languages already have official (or non-official) images you can use. For example, the [`node`
image][hub-node] already has Node.js installed: you only need to base your own image off of it and
add your application's code.

You will find a minimal Dockerfile to do that in the `Dockerfile.min` file in the `todo` directory
of this repository. This is what it contains:

```
FROM node:8

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . /usr/src/app/
RUN npm install

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

Here's what the instructions are for:

* `FROM node:8` instructs Docker to build from the official `node:8` image (which contains the
  latest Node.js 8 version).
* `WORKDIR /usr/src/app` indicates the working directory in which commands are run (e.g. when using
  a `RUN` instruction).
* `COPY . /usr/src/app` copies the entire contents of the build context to the `/usr/src/app`
  directory in the container.
* `RUN npm install` executes an `npm install` command to install the application's dependencies. Due
  to the previous `WORKDIR` instruction, this is executed in the `/usr/src/app` directory of the
  container.
* `CMD [ "npm", "start" ]` indicates the default command that will be executed when running this
  container. This is equivalent to the arguments we passed to `docker run <image> <command...>`. If
  a default command is specified in the image with `CMD`, you can simply use `docker run <image>` to
  run that command.

Move to the `todo` directory and build a new image based on that Dockerfile:

```bash
$> cd todo
$> docker build -t todo .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  60.93kB
Step 1/5 : FROM node:8
 ---> 4635bc7d130c
Step 2/5 : WORKDIR /usr/src/app
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 9e5af697d233
Step 3/5 : COPY . /usr/src/app/
 ---> 0c7a80e4fedc
Step 4/5 : RUN npm install
 ---> Running in 0122811036db
added 142 packages in 2.822s
Removing intermediate container 0122811036db
 ---> 13546c3ce198
Step 5/5 : CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
 ---> Running in 8becf1bd710d
Removing intermediate container 8becf1bd710d
 ---> a8dc25bf2972
Successfully built a8dc25bf2972
Successfully tagged todo:latest
```

You can now attempt to run the application:

```bash
$> docker run --rm todo

> todo@0.0.0 start /usr/src/app
> node ./bin/www

{ MongoNetworkError: failed to connect to server [localhost:27017] on first connect [MongoNetworkError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017]
    ... }
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 1
npm ERR! todo@0.0.0 start: `node ./bin/www`
npm ERR! Exit status 1
npm ERR!
npm ERR! Failed at the todo@0.0.0 start script.
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
npm ERR!     /root/.npm/_logs/2018-04-23T15_27_29_784Z-debug.log
```

It doesn't work because it attempts to connect to a MongoDB database on `localhost:27017` and there
is no such thing. Even if you do actually have a MongoDB database running on that port for
development, remember that each container has its own isolated network stack, so it can't reach
services listening on your machine's ports by default.





## Best Practices

### Squashing layers

It is considered good practice to minimize the number of layers in a Docker image:

* There will be fewer layers to download (when pulling an image from the Docker hub).
* The build will be faster as larger chunks of the build process will be cached.

There are two things we can do to simply our current Dockerfile.
The first is to make the `clock.sh` script executable so that we don't need the last `RUN`
instruction of the Dockerfile any more. The `COPY` instruction conserves file permissions:

```bash
$> chmod +x clock.sh
```

The second is to use only 1 `RUN` instruction instead of 3.
Write a `RUN` instruction like this will only create 1 layer:

```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y fortune && apt-get install -y cowsay
```

You may use slashes to split the command into multiple lines for readability:

```
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y fortune && \
    apt-get install -y cowsay
```

Your final Dockerfile should look like this:

```
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y fortune && \
    apt-get install -y cowsay

COPY clock.sh /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
```

Run the same build command as before:

```bash
$> docker build -t fortune-clock:3.0 .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB
Step 1/3 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> c9d990395902
Step 2/3 : RUN apt-get update &&     apt-get install -y fortune &&     apt-get install -y cowsay
...
 ---> Running in 7a652ff4ab0d
Removing intermediate container 7a652ff4ab0d
 ---> 3ad4e786e5eb
Step 3/3 : COPY clock.sh /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
 ---> 4fa0c71e952c
Successfully built 4fa0c71e952c
Successfully tagged fortune-clock:3.0
```

If you inspect the resulting image, you will see that there are only 2 new layers, one for the `RUN`
instruction, and one for the `COPY` instruction:

```
$> docker inspect fortune-clock:3.0
...
        "RootFS": {
            "Type": "layers",
            "Layers": [
                "sha256:fccbfa2912f0cd6b9d13f91f288f112a2b825f3f758a4443aacb45bfc108cc74",
                "sha256:e1a9a6284d0d24d8194ac84b372619e75cd35a46866b74925b7274c7056561e4",
                "sha256:ac7299292f8b2f710d3b911c6a4e02ae8f06792e39822e097f9c4e9c2672b32d",
                "sha256:a5e66470b2812e91798db36eb103c1f1e135bbe167e4b2ad5ba425b8db98ee8d",
                "sha256:a8de0e025d94b33db3542e1e8ce58829144b30c6cd1fff057eec55b1491933c3",
                "sha256:3395f7dea253615f40e90014d99f91636ac4da015653e93c82c8f3296839d7d9",
                "sha256:fc263405dc2cbb4ae56ba7eabad0b0fdc5b39a64adf7239e907486f460f6a085"
            ]
        },
...
```

Modify the `clock.sh` script again (e.g. add a comment or a new line) and re-run the same build
command:

```bash
$> docker build -t fortune-clock:3.0 .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB
Step 1/3 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> c9d990395902
Step 2/3 : RUN apt-get update &&     apt-get install -y fortune &&     apt-get install -y cowsay
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 3ad4e786e5eb
Step 3/3 : COPY clock.sh /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
 ---> 29ac649d902f
Successfully built 29ac649d902f
Successfully tagged fortune-clock:3.0
```

As you can see, the entire `RUN` instruction is cached again, but only 1 layer had to be retrieved
from the cache. Then the `COPY` instruction is executed without the cache, as expected.

#### Using the `--squash` option

Another way to squash layers is to add the `--squash` option to the build command:

```bash
$> docker build -t fortune-clock:3.0 --squash .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB
Step 1/3 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> c9d990395902
Step 2/3 : RUN apt-get update &&     apt-get install -y fortune &&     apt-get install -y cowsay
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 3ad4e786e5eb
Step 3/3 : COPY clock.sh /usr/local/bin/clock.sh
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 29ac649d902f
Successfully built e036c40ed4c1
Successfully tagged fortune-clock:3.0
```

If you inspect the resulting image, you will see that there is only 1 additional layer compared to
the base `ubuntu` image (in this case, the one starting with `56286e292`):

```bash
$> docker build -t fortune-clock:3.0 --squash .
...
        "RootFS": {
            "Type": "layers",
            "Layers": [
                "sha256:fccbfa2912f0cd6b9d13f91f288f112a2b825f3f758a4443aacb45bfc108cc74",
                "sha256:e1a9a6284d0d24d8194ac84b372619e75cd35a46866b74925b7274c7056561e4",
                "sha256:ac7299292f8b2f710d3b911c6a4e02ae8f06792e39822e097f9c4e9c2672b32d",
                "sha256:a5e66470b2812e91798db36eb103c1f1e135bbe167e4b2ad5ba425b8db98ee8d",
                "sha256:a8de0e025d94b33db3542e1e8ce58829144b30c6cd1fff057eec55b1491933c3",
                "sha256:56286e2923cafe6b814ae99b8ad2a104be49c870accffa468c17add09f8e2a35"
            ]
        },
...
```

When using the `--squash` option, the new layers are combined into a new image with a single new
layer once the build process is complete. Squashing does not destroy any existing image, rather it
creates a new image with the content of the squashed layers. This effectively makes it look like all
Dockerfile commands were created with a single layer.

Squashing layers can be beneficial if your Dockerfile produces multiple layers modifying the same
files, for example, files that are created in one step, and removed in another step. For other
use cases, squashing images may actually have a negative impact on performance; squashed layers
cannot be reused between images, as they always have a new hash regardless of whether they have the
same content.

Note that the `--squash` option is an experimental feature, and should not be considered stable.

### Dockerfile tips

In the `todo` directory, you will find a `Dockerfile.full` file which is a more complete Dockerfile
than the one used as a first example. Its contents are:

```
FROM node:8-alpine

LABEL maintainer="mei-admin@heig-vd.ch"

ENV NODE_ENV=production \
    PORT=3000

RUN addgroup -S todo && \
    adduser -S -G todo todo && \
    mkdir -p /usr/src/app && \
    chown todo:todo /usr/src/app

USER todo:todo

COPY --chown=todo:todo package.json package-lock.json /usr/src/app/

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
RUN npm install

COPY --chown=todo:todo . /usr/src/app/

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

Let's see what all of this means.

#### Using smaller base images

Many popular Docker images these days have an Alpine variant. This means that the image is based on
the [official `alpine` image][hub-alpine] on Docker hub, based on the [Alpine Linux][alpine]
distribution. Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads
to much slimmer images in general.

```
FROM node:8-alpine
```

Here we use the `node:8-alpine` tag instead of simply `node:8`.

These variants are highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired.
The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc][musl-libc] instead of [glibc and
friends][glibc-etc], so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc
requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a
very safe choice. See this [Hacker News comment thread][alpine-size] for more discussion of the
issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.

To minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as Git or Bash) to be
included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own
Dockerfile (see the [alpine image description][hub-alpine] for examples of how to install packages
if you are unfamiliar).

#### Labeling images

It is good practice to label your images with the `LABEL` instruction. A popular convention is to
add a `maintainer` label to provide a maintenance contact e-mail:

```
LABEL maintainer="mei-admin@heig-vd.ch"
```
